TASKS TO DO:

-BLOCK ID GETS MESSED UP WHEN THE PROGRAM MOVES TO THE SECOND CONTENT BLOCK

ie. new_size: 512

This is because there is only one content block allocated, but get_file_content assumes that full frames are allocated

output2.txt:
anomaly at line 7311

-Allocating a free block breaks when 32 blocks are filled and it has to allocate a bitmap at the next index of the freemap array







Specification Notes:

Primary Goal: Implement a Simple File System (SFS)

Contains features:
	-limits max length for file and directory names
	-single level directory
	-opens files and allows them to be read and written to

Functions to be implemented:

int sfs_mkfs()
	-> Possibly already implemented?
	-> 

sfs_superblock_t *sfs_print_info()


-Each directory block has capacity for N inodes
-Each inode contains several content blocks, together describing 1 file
